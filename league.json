Essentially, the Teemo does a most excellent job of predicting and randomizing his movements in order to weave in and around them.  The slomo section at the end shows him at a sliver of health with a minion attack coming right at him when he turns and hits the minion and uses his LS (life steal) by hitting the minion first to avoid being killed by a tiny mob, then the camera pans over to the last person who was going to teleport back to base by hiding in a bush, and runs into one of the hidden mushrooms in the bush, killing him.\n\nThis is funny to a lot of people because Teemo is a ridiculously designed character.  He's got a bunch of happy little animal kind of voice lines with a ridiculously dark lore, and his poisons are super strong, he's got another passive not shown in the video where he turns invisible to almost everything if he just stands still.

Most of Fnatic's leads are not coming from him m8, it's coming from the solo lanes then Rekkles carries later. \n\n", "downs": 0, "created_utc": 1503073675.0, "subreddit": "leagueoflegends", "score": 1, "ups": 1}, "dlsb29s": {"body": "45 kills at 11 minutes, classic", "downs": 0, "created_utc": 1503030773.0, "subreddit": "leagueoflegends", "score": 22, "ups": 22}, "dlsim7a": {"body": "Hi!\n\nI'm looking for new games with massively online multiplayer, I am playin mostly League/Overwatch/CSGO/POE and PUBG.\n\nHope for some help, Thanks!", "downs": 0, "created_utc": 1503047879.0, "subreddit": "leagueoflegends", "score": 1, "ups": 1}, "dlsvzmp": {"body": "The problem with that is that champions that are balanced around their shields gets a big indirect nerf in comparison to their non-shielding counterpart.

Did it ever occur that I might agree that the TL cancer post shouldn't have stayed up? It's like you're reading from a script and have no interest in debating outside of it. \n\nI'll bite for you though, because I'm nice.

Has the highest Death% of any top-laner. \nsOAZ is 2nd or 3rd in a lot of categories, and rarely beaten out by the same player more than once. The fact that his death share is the highest is because the rest of FNC dies comparably less even when it comes to the entire league, as sOAZ's # of deaths is 69 (15 more than the Kikis who has the least, but 7 fewer games and **48** fewer than Vizicsacsi who's had the most deaths - 117).\n\nDespite the fact that he gets a lot of early attention (that is my impression, anyway), sOAZ gets the least attention and resources in the late game, but still puts up competitive damage numbers (compared to other top laners), is valuable (in terms of fulfilling his role) and doesn't die that much. Also, he's second in KP%, meaning he knows very well where he has to be most of the time.\n\n> Doesn't push his advantage out of lane and focuses more on the ability of Fnatic's other members to dictate the game tempo + fights.\n\nsOAZ's forte is his tank play and despite being put on the tanks a lot, his death numbers are fairly negligible. There's no doubt that he's the best tank top in EU LCS. While there was a lot of attention focused on Rekkles during the pre-RR period, sOAZ facilitated a lot of that style by his excellent Shen play and overall splitpushing. Everything is not in the numbers, although most are still very favourable to sOAZ nonetheless. He's had a number of great games and very few poor ones - the overall consistency makes sure that his bad performances don't stick out, something I can't say about Csacsi, since he's looked hell-bent on solving Africa's famine in a lot of his games.\n\n> How could you make the case for sOAZ over Odo or Vizi?\n\nThe case over Csacsi is pretty clear in my mind - dude's been way too inconsistent this split and not at all dominant. UOL as a whole relied a lot more on their teamfighting than Csacsi straight up carrying from the top lane.\n\nThe case for Odoamne is slightly different. Looking at stats, he trails sOAZ in most categories, but the laning stats (which you use as a knock against sOAZ), are all negative for Odoamne and he only barely edges out sOAZ in the categories where he is ahead (minus damage rate and other stats that aren't readily available). Last argument against Odo is more team-oriented. For somebody that should be considered the best or at least 2nd best (over sOAZ and/or Csacsi), he's been playing on a team that dropped every match against other top tier teams (G2, UoL and FNC). sOAZ can claim wins against all of them and Csacsi against every team except FNC. While there's a lot more to it than just the mere W or L once the series has concluded, it's pretty jarring to see somebody only beat out the worse teams and not get much done against the top teams.

With normal cooldowns, people aim carefully cause they only do so every couple of seconds. Look at that Vel'Koz, some of his abilities, especially his Q are *extremly* off. You know why? Cause he's rapidly pressing tons of buttons and barely has any time to aim.\n\nZilean? First bomb didn't go on Teemo, second bomb was the worst thing he could have done (predicting teemo to walk 300 units into the tower while already having aggro, ye that's sure gonna happen dude), third bomb thrown on the wukong clone (no dodging involved), number 4, 5 and 6 are dodged yeah but again, dodging a Zilean Q with that movement speed is actually really easy. And tbh, the only thing, the actually only thing Zilean had to do here is point and click E on Teemo. Instead he was walking around in circles and doing, well, not much.\n\nWukong? Boosted out hard. He's not lvl 11 yet so his ult does 20 + the AD scaling dmg/sec. It's actually really, really low. He missed out on using a lvl 4 E and a lvl 2 Q on teemo (assuming teemo wouldn't be able to Q him before the Wukong Q, considering Wukong was invisible and really fucking close to Teemo I'd say that's unlikely), maybe E into ult would have been better even, doesn't really matter, all we know is that this is the worst way Wukong could have played it out. I mean, why the fuck is he using his W? Teemo just flashed into E range to attack Vel'Koz. Was he scared Teemo flashed to attack him? Then his reaction time is at least 450ms. Anyways, he randomly W's instead of E'ing teemo (and either using Q, Ult, W into another E, or the best way: E into Ult into W into E+Q).\n\nLooking at the way Vel'Koz moves (more precisely, doesn't move) tell you a lot about how good the dude is. He's just standing still and still missing the Q reactivation time by 400 units. He does not reposition properly and wastes 2 (maybe 3?) Q's cause they're point blanc into the minion wave and split instantly. Instead of moving, he cancels his own basic attack animation a couple of times.\n\nNice play by Teemo, but potato enemies + urf enabled him here big time. High movement speed + extremly low cooldowns will always favor the player with the point and click stuff over the one with the skillshots.
