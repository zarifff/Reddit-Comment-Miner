He doesn't have layers, or filters, or tactics. If he says \"I like people who weren't captured\", he will never then say \"Okay, maybe that was over the line\".  He doesn't ever apologize. His hardcore base sees that as a sign of strength - he means what he says, and diplomacy is for pussies. But a growing number of people are realizing that a) diplomacy does serve a purpose, b) presidents play their games at too high a level for shit-talking to help much, and c) Trump's shit-talking is revealing what a truly horrible, stupid person he is.
